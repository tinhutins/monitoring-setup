  # The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example,
  # multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would
  # be batched into a single group.
  #
  # To aggregate by all possible labels use the special value '...' as the sole label name, for example:
  # group_by: ['...']
  # This effectively disables aggregation entirely, passing through all
  # alerts as-is. This is unlikely to be what you want, unless you have
  # a very low alert volume or your upstream notification system performs
  # its own grouping.
  group_by: [alertname]
  # How long to initially wait to send a notification for a group
  # of alerts. Allows to wait for an inhibiting alert to arrive or collect
  # more initial alerts for the same group. (Usually ~0s to few minutes.)
  group_wait: 30s 
  # How long to wait before sending a notification about new alerts that
  # are added to a group of alerts for which an initial notification has
  # already been sent. (Usually ~5m or more.)
  group_interval: 5m 
  # How long to wait before sending a notification again if it has already
  # been sent successfully for an alert. (Usually ~3h or more).
